<h4>April 15, 2009</h4>
<hr/>

I hope to release something in the summer when I have more time. 
I tried to develop a voxel engine because at the time that I took over the project, OpenGL was not 100% free on gNewSense. 
Now that it is, I realize that my voxel engine is slow, cumbersome, and extremely limited. 
Also, I'm not sure how to extend it. 
So I've been hacking on OpenGL for a bit and I think I should have something good soon.
