<h3>Introduction to GNU Kart</h3>

<p>
This is a web page about GNU Kart, which is a simple racing game for GNU.

<h3>News</h3>

<h4>May 11, 2010</h4>
<hr/>

SpeedX is now GNU Kart. 
The "X" in the name "SpeedX" referred to the X window system, which especially made sense because it heavily used X11 libraries. 
GNU Kart doesn't use X11 libraries directly, and mostly uses OpenGL. 
If you check out the latest source in Bazaar, you will see that I am testing a track format that is based on spheres of different radii connected by edges that form tubes that tell which edge a player is traveling along and which sphere they are heading toward.

<h4>April 15, 2009</h4>
<hr/>

I hope to release something in the summer when I have more time. 
I tried to develop a voxel engine because at the time that I took over the project, OpenGL was not 100% free on gNewSense. 
Now that it is, I realize that my voxel engine is slow, cumbersome, and extremely limited. 
Also, I'm not sure how to extend it. 
So I've been hacking on OpenGL for a bit and I think I should have something good soon. 
Even without hardware acceleration (which I don't have, since there are very few free 3D graphics drivers), OpenGL seems fine as long as the scene stays simple, and the point of this game is to be a simple, easily playable game that anyone can enjoy quickly so it seems like it will work fine, even on a system where Neverball or SuperTuxKart are not playable.
