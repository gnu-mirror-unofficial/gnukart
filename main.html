<h2>GNU Kart</h2>
<hr class="thin" />

<p>
GNU Kart is a simple racing game for GNU. It uses OpenGL and SDL for
graphics and features GNU characters. Its aim will be extensibility
so that a general kind of racing game can be made, with any sorts of
features.

<h3>History</h3>

<dl>
<dt>September 14, 2010: GNU Kart Alpha 0.3.0</dt>
<dd>
<p>GNU Kart is a kart racing game for GNU using characters based on
GNU/Free Software stuff.</p>

<p>There are currently three characters that have a (incomplete) 3D model
to them: GNU, guile, and icecat.</p>

<p>You have to run it from the command line and it only lets you go
through one lap and then quits, but the computer characters will drive
around the track nicely.</p>

<p>SpeedX is now GNU Kart. 
The “X” in the name “SpeedX” referred to the X window system, which
especially made sense because it heavily used X11 libraries. 
GNU Kart doesn't use X11 libraries directly, and mostly uses OpenGL. 
If you check out the latest source in Bazaar, you will see that I am
testing a track format that is based on spheres of different radii
connected by edges that form tubes that tell which edge a player is
traveling along and which sphere they are heading toward.</p>

<p>I hope to release something in the summer when I have more time. 
I tried to develop a voxel engine because at the time that I took over
the project, OpenGL was not 100% free on gNewSense. 
Now that it is, I realize that my voxel engine is slow, cumbersome,
and extremely limited. 
Also, I'm not sure how to extend it. 
So I've been hacking on OpenGL for a bit and I think I should have
something good soon. 
Even without hardware acceleration (which I don't have, since there are
very few free 3D graphics drivers), OpenGL seems fine as long as the
scene stays simple, and the point of this game is to be a simple, easily
playable game that anyone can enjoy quickly so it seems like it will
work fine, even on a system where Neverball or SuperTuxKart are not
playable.</p>
